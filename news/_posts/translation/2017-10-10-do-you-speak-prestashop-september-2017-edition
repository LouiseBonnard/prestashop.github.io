Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in September.

## Project news


### Get ready for version 1.7.3.0

We're currently working on version 1.7.3, which is planned for October. That means an update of the content source on Crowdin, and possibly new strings to be translated in October. We'll let you know when it's ready for you to translate!

### 1.6 Validation

There are some translations for version 1.6 awaiting validation. While we don't have enough proofreaders to validate all this content, we've decided to automatically validate what's left in 1.6. That way all the translations for 1.6 will be available in the software.
If there are mistakes in this content, making it available in the software will probably help bring more translators and proofreaders to the project - at least that's what we hope ;)
And if you're interested in proofreading PrestaShop translations, <a href="mailto:translation@prestashop.com?subject=Proofreading%20PrestaShop%20Translations">do get in touch with us</a>!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of August 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Arabic** (53% translated vs 19% validated in 1.7).
* **Korean** (37% vs 9% in 1.7).
* **Portuguese, Brazil** (100% vs 79% in 1.7 - there's been a huge progress, keep up the good work!).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (52% vs 32% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (66% vs 47% in 1.7).
